city as compared to other\n                      cities (i.e Stockholm, Copenhagen), so it prides itself as\n                      a University Town! this generally translates to a more\n                      vibrant and youthful culture{\" \"}\n                      <Emoji symbol=\"🙂\" label=\"smiley face\" /> Locals are vvv\n                      friendly & v willing to help because they’re all around\n                      our age haha. Since there isn’t much to do in Lund, the\n                      school has many activities and CCAs to join and they’re\n                      very accepting as well. You get to join a nation\n                      (something like a hall/CCA) and be part of their weekly\n                      activities which includes brunch events, cooking, sports,\n                      clubbing etc and you only have to pay about $5-10 to join\n                      these events. There are lots of CCAs to choose from as\n                      well – i.e. Case Consulting Clubs, Finance, Marketing,\n                      Photography, and they even have mentoring Clubs. I was in\n                      one of the clubs and they were really very accepting even\n                      though I only stayed for a semester while everyone else in\n                      the club had a one year commitment. I would say its a fine\n                      balance between a fun and study focused school.\n                    </p>\n                    <p className=\"content\">\n                      XL: Swedes are generally really friendly, try to learn a\n                      few swedish phrases like greetings (or take the free intro\n                      to swedish mod during orientation) can really make their\n                      day and show your appreciation of their culture. The\n                      school also has the tradition of student nations. They are\n                      similar to our “colleges and halls”. Activities at the\n                      nation are hosted by students for students, they include\n                      pubs, bars, clubs, themed dinner etc. Students are very\n                      encouraged to join a nation (out of the 13 nations),\n                      exchange students are very welcomed. Though sometimes they\n                      tend to speak swedish a lot, they are very friendly to\n                      exchangers.{\" \"}\n                    </p>\n                    <p className=\"content\">\n                      JK: Quite relaxed overall, Swedish are known to be rather\n                      cold but I personally thought they were pretty friendly.\n                      There are different student nations to join for social\n                      activities like clubbing, weekend buffets, similar to\n                      halls in Singapore but you don’t actually stay there.\n                    </p>\n                    <p className=\"content\">\n                      JW: Generally the culture is quite chill, most classes\n                      have a huge mix of exchangers, sometimes even more so than\n                      the locals so it’s a good time to make friends from all\n                      around the world! When it comes to partying and having\n                      fun, Sweden can get quite expensive as alcohol is heavily\n                      controlled by the government. But the school has this\n                      thing called nations, which are actually run by the\n                      students, and most nations have a weekly clubbing event.\n                      The downside to this is you need a student card to enter\n                      to all these events, so it’s really bad if you have\n                      friends from other unis coming to visit you as you won’t\n                      be allowed to enter.\n                    </p>\n                    <p className=\"content\">\n                      FQ: Swedes are really nice and friendly to interact with.\n                      They would recommend good places to eat on campus. Also\n                      managed to start conversations with locals at the bus stop\n                      after a “Hi, wow its really cold” hahah. But we do\n                      interact with exchangers more due to our modules and that\n                      overseas students and exchangers are housed together.\n                      There are also different nations (kinda like halls/ccas)\n                      that we can join and they have a variety of activities\n                      planned every week (from chill to clubbing). So theres\n                      definitely something enjoyable for everyone. But if you’re\n                      also looking for activities that are not organised by the\n                      school (E.g. external events, concerts), I don’t think\n                      theres much going on in Lund.\n                    </p>\n                  </Grid.Column>\n                </Grid.Row>\n                <Grid.Row>\n                  <Grid.Column>\n                    <h2 className=\"subtitle_left\">Attendance Levels</h2>\n                    <p className=\"content\">\n                      G: This depends on the modules!

The locals and other exchange students are\n                      very proactive in asking questions and engaging in class\n                      discussions. The workload is very manageable, one week\n                      perhaps 2-3 classes only. Usually a group project and\n                      quizes. Attendance is mandatory for intro and conclusion\n                      classes.

Groceries can be cheap because of economies\n                      of scale due to the sheer number of NUS kids that go\n                      there, but overall if you’re looking for a cheap exchange,\n                      the cheapest thing about Lund is the airfares out to\n                      various European cities via Ryanair.\n                    </p>\n                    <p className=\"content\">\n                      S/SY/C: Groceries are around $4/meal but we go to the\n                      supermarket almost every other day. I would say every week\n                      is about ~ $35-50 I mostly cooked together with my\n                      housemates thus the cost of groceries were shared among\n                      us, and it was quite affordable but groceries are mostly a\n                      bit more expensive than SG. It is good if you can find a\n                      few more friends to share the cost with, because like can\n                      share costs for condiments, and buy in bulk etc! There’s a\n                      few Asian marts in the city centre that sells very nice\n                      and affordable asian groceries so don’t worry too much\n                      about missing asian food! Would recommend cooking most of\n                      your meals as eating out can be quite expensive! and some\n                      restaurants there don’t rly like the idea of sharing, so\n                      they expect each person to order a main~\n                    </p>\n                  </Grid.Column>\n                </Grid.Row>\n                <Grid.Row>\n                  <Grid.Column>\n                    <h2 className=\"subtitle_center\">Accomodation Choices</h2>\n\n                    <p className=\"content\">\n                      G: They have lots of hostels and I think everyone in my\n                      batch who went to Lund stayed in a hostel! You can choose\n                      to stay alone, or with a roomie. I stayed in Sofieberg\n                      with 6 other friends and it was only a 5 min walk from\n                      school so we only had to leave our apartment 5 mins before\n                      class starts. Would totally recommend this place because\n                      it was only 2 years old when we stayed there so the\n                      facilities are rly new!! Also, on days when its raining or\n                      if the weather gets super bad and you don’t wanna leave\n                      your room (esp winter season), you can just run to school\n                      from your apartment haha – that was what most of us did in\n                      December and it helps a lot. Also, there’s a supermarket\n                      and gym near the school (which again, is near our\n                      apartment) so it makes things a lot easier for us as well!\n                    </p>\n                    <p className=\"content\">\n                      XL: The uni is very accessible, mainly depending on where\n                      your accommodation is. I highly recommend Sofieberg which\n                      is just opposite the school (literally cross a road). The\n                      accoms is very new, clean and comfortable. ICA (their\n                      local supermarket) is right beside the school as well so\n                      its very convenient for grocery shopping. Bikes are\n                      available at the rental shops at affordable prices. Lund\n                      is a very bike friendly city, literally everyone is on\n                      bikes there. So if you are a morning person who doesnt\n                      mind sweating a little for a 815am class, you can consider\n                      choosing a cheaper accomms which is further away. For\n                      accoms, you will also have the choice of choosing a\n                      roomate or leaving it to fate. Slots for rooming together\n                      are in high demand and can run out fast, so be sure to\n                      submit the application form right when the portal open.\n                      Rentals are paid via the portal every month.\n                    </p>\n                    <p className=\"content\">\n                      JK: All NUS Business students stayed in the school\n                      compound, mainly at 2 different student hostels\n                      (Klostergarden and Sofieberg) Klostergarden was very\n                      affordable but much father from the business school in\n                      Lund whereas Sofieberg was literally a stone’s throw away\n                      from the business school and much newer but rental was 2-3\n                      times that of Klostergarden. There were other NTU and SMU\n                      students who unfortunately did not secure school\n                      accommodation and had to resort to Airbnbs, which were\n                      definitely pricier.\n                    </p>\n                    <p className=\"content\">\n                      JW: I stayed in Sofieberg, and I highly recommend this\n                      place to stay if you are a business student! It’s just\n                      across the road from school, which is perfect for the\n                      winter. It’s also directly above the Lund accoms office,\n                      so on your first day there, when you collect your keys,\n                      you’ll never get lost to your apartment because it’s\n                      literally right there.\n                    </p>\n                    <p className=\"content\">\n                      FQ: There are alot of accommodation types to choose from.\n                      Ive seen various accommodations and they were all quite\n                      spacious. I stayed at Eddan and the layout was like a 4/5\n                      room HDB flat where there were a common kitchen area and 4\n                      rooms, each with their own toilet and shower. Thus, I had\n                      the opportunity to interact and live with 3 other students\n                      from India, Lebanon and New Zealand. Eddan is located in a\n                      quiet neighbourhood and near a park. So the view is really\n                      nice and if you stay on the higher floors you may catch\n                      the sunset too. It is about a 15 mins bus ride from LUSEM\n                      and on the way to school. You will get to pass by some\n                      horses too! It will take around 25 minutes to get to the\n                      central.\n                    </p>\n                  </Grid.Column>\n                </Grid.Row>\n                <Grid divided=\"vertically\" Columns={4}>\n                  <Grid.Row columns={4}>\n                    <Grid.Column>\n                      <Image src={require(\"./Lund_pic4.jpg\")} alt=\"pic4\" />\n                    </Grid.Column>\n                    <Grid.Column>\n                      <Image src={require(\"./Lund_pic5.jpg\")} alt=\"pic5\" />\n                    </Grid.Column>\n                    <Grid.Column>\n                      <Image src={require(\"./Lund_pic6.jpg\")} alt=\"pic6\" />\n                    </Grid.Column>\n                    <Grid.Column>\n                      <Image src={require(\"./Lund_pic7.jpg\")} alt=\"pic7\" />\n                    </Grid.Column>\n                  </Grid.Row>\n                </Grid>\n              </Grid>\n            </Container>\n          </Grid.Column>\n        </Grid>\n      </div>\n    );\n  }\n}\n\nexport default Lund;\n"]},"metadata":{},"sourceType":"module"}
