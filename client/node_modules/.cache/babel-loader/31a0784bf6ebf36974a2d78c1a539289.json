(they sell\n                      nice-smelling bread and this bite-sized corn bread thing\n                      at subway stations and it’s good). But buses over subway\n                      still. Can’t eat on the buses but you get closer to where\n                      you want with buses! Just use Google or Kakao maps and you\n                      should be fine (people always say Google Maps don’t work\n                      well in Korea but my friends and I used it throughout).
