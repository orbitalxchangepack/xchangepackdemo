The shopping was good though, many brands\n                      were cheaper than in Singapore, and outlets were only a\n                      30min Uber ride away from NYU. NYU gave us free museum\n                      access to MOMA, and the MET had Friday nights free too.\n                      Broadway shows were >$100 even with NYU discounts/\n                      Broadway Roulette. Additionally, NYU makes you buy a\n                      compulsory health insurance plan which is about US$200.\n                      Overall, NYC is really really expensive to live in, so be\n                      realistic about budgeting when applying.\n                    </p>\n                  </Grid.Column>\n                </Grid.Row>\n                <Grid.Row>\n                  <Grid.Column>\n                    <h2 className=\"subtitle_left\">Accommodation</h2>\n                    <p className=\"content\">\n                      We chose to stay off campus because campus accommodations\n                      were US$9k for a three person shared room, including a\n                      compulsory meal plan. We valued convenience over price and\n                      size, so we paid US$3k/month for a two bedroom studio\n                      apartment in Soho, which was 10minutes from school.\n                      However, our apartment was tiny – there was no living\n                      space, only a kitchen area and the rooms were about the\n                      same size as Halls. It did come with free cleaning and\n                      free laundry, which was really convenient. Our friends\n                      stayed in Brooklyn for a much larger space at the same\n                      price, but we knew other exchangers who managed to find\n                      US$1k/ rooms in Brooklyn. If you’re planning to stay in\n                      Manhattan/ near school, be prepared to pay.\n                    </p>\n                  </Grid.Column>\n                </Grid.Row>\n              </Grid>\n            </Container>\n          </Grid.Column>\n        </Grid>\n      </div>\n    );\n  }\n}\n\nexport default NYU;\n"]},"metadata":{},"sourceType":"module"}
