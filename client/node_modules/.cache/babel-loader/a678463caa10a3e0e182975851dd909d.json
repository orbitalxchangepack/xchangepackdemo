So my apartment is right in the middle of an estate, and my neighbours are all Danish families instead of fellow students so it\\u2019s pretty cool and peaceful:) (the stars that can be seen every night from my balcony made exchange an even better experience) My accommodation is the same as Daryl, it\\u2019s a 15min bus ride to the city and 15min bus ride from my apartment so it\\u2019s very central, But one thing to note is that the intervals between bus arrivals are HUGE so you\\u2019ll have to check the bus timings carefully and make sure to not miss your bus if not you\\u2019ll be late for class.\"))), /*#__PURE__*/React.createElement(Grid.Row, {\n      __self: this,\n      __source: {\n        fileName: _jsxFileName,\n        lineNumber: 234,\n        columnNumber: 17\n      }\n    }, /*#__PURE__*/React.createElement(Grid.Column, {\n      width: 5,\n      __self: this,\n      __source: {\n        fileName: _jsxFileName,\n        lineNumber: 235,\n        columnNumber: 19\n      }\n    }, /*#__PURE__*/React.createElement(Image, {\n      src: require(\"./Aarhus_pic8.jpg\"),\n      alt: \"pic8\",\n      __self: this,\n      __source: {\n        fileName: _jsxFileName,\n        lineNumber: 236,\n        columnNumber: 21\n      }\n    })), /*#__PURE__*/React.createElement(Grid.Column, {\n      width: 5,\n      __self: this,\n      __source: {\n        fileName: _jsxFileName,\n        lineNumber: 238,\n        columnNumber: 19\n      }\n    }, /*#__PURE__*/React.createElement(Image, {\n      src: require(\"./Aarhus_pic9.jpg\"),\n      alt: \"pic9\",\n      __self: this,\n      __source: {\n        fileName: _jsxFileName,\n        lineNumber: 239,\n        columnNumber: 21\n      }\n    })), /*#__PURE__*/React.createElement(Grid.Column, {\n      width: 6,\n      __self: this,\n      __source: {\n        fileName: _jsxFileName,\n        lineNumber: 241,\n        columnNumber: 19\n      }\n    }, /*#__PURE__*/React.createElement(\"h2\", {\n      className: \"subtitle_left\",\n      __self: this,\n      __source: {\n        fileName: _jsxFileName,\n        lineNumber: 242,\n        columnNumber: 21\n      }\n    }, \"Closing Thoughts\"), /*#__PURE__*/React.createElement(\"p\", {\n      className: \"content\",\n      __self: this,\n      __source: {\n        fileName: _jsxFileName,\n        lineNumber: 243,\n        columnNumber: 21\n      }\n    }, \"D: I had no regrets choosing Aarhus. Not only were the school curriculum chill (no attendance policy), i made the best friends and had a great time cooking and sharing food with them on the nights I was in Denmark. The Danish, even though they look unapproachable, were actually super friendly people! If I did not travel as much as I did, I would definitely have integrated myself more in the school culture and partied with them harder! If you are someone who wants to have fun while staying in a safe and lovely neighbourhood, I would definitely recommend this city!\"))))))));\n  }\n\n}\n\nexport default

Most times they make\n                      learning in class a lot more interesting as they\n                      frequently give their own inputs, perspectives and new\n                      findings into teaching that are outside of what the boring\n                      textbooks will teach.\n                    </p>\n                  </Grid.Column>\n                </Grid.Row>\n                <Grid.Row columns={3}>\n                  <Grid.Column width={4}>\n                    <Image src={require(\"./Aarhus_pic5.jpg\")} alt=\"pic5\" />\n                  </Grid.Column>\n                  <Grid.Column width={7}>\n                    <h2 className=\"subtitle_center\">Location</h2>\n                    <p className=\"content\">\n                      Aarhus is the 2nd largest city in Denmark, and it is known\n                      to be a student city given the number of students staying\n                      in the city itself. However, it is located very far from\n                      the main airport, Copenhagen, around 3-4 hours by Bus or\n                      Train which will cost around S$15-30 one way dependent on\n                      how early you buy the tickets. There is Aarhus/Billund\n                      airport nearby but they have lesser flights and\n                      connections to other European hubs. The costs for the\n                      shuttle buses to the airport also cost upwards of S$20 so\n                      do factor this in when you are planning to travel often.\n                      Often, I will combine different cities together and travel\n                      at one go to save these small costs!\n                    </p>\n                  </Grid.Column>\n                  <Grid.Column width={5}>\n                    <Image src={require(\"./Aarhus_pic6.jpg\")} alt=\"pic6\" />\n                  </Grid.Column>\n                </Grid.Row>\n                <Grid.Row>\n                  <Grid.Column>\n                    <h2 className=\"subtitle_left\">Getting Around</h2>\n                    <p className=\"content\">\n                      D: It is a bike city, so many of us rented bikes from\n                      Swapfites, but we ended up taking the buses because it was\n                      either too cold, or it was more convenient to take the\n                      bus. TY: As Singaporeans there you’ll start to find\n                      options to save money, for example knowing which bus lines\n                      doesn’t require ticket checking, so you don’t have to buy\n                      tickets for those trips. Buses are differentiated based on\n                      their colours. For example, for blue buses, the bus\n                      conductor will check for your ticket before boarding,\n                      while yellow buses do random spot checks on whether you\n                      did buy a ticket. Do your necessary planning of risk and\n                      note the expensive fines you will incur if you do decide\n                      to not buy the tickets!.\n                    </p>\n                  </Grid.Column>\n                </Grid.Row>\n                <Grid.Row>\n                  <Grid.Column width={4}>\n                    <Image src={require(\"./Aarhus_pic7.jpg\")} alt=\"pic7\" />\n                  </Grid.Column>\n                  <Grid.Column width={12}>\n                    <h2 className=\"subtitle_left\">Cost of Living</h2>\n                    <p className=\"content\">\n                      Overall, Denmark is expensive to eat out, and every time I\n                      am in Aarhus, we usually buy groceries and cook at home.\n                      Meals outside will cost a minimum of $S15, going up to\n                      S$50 dependent on the cuisine.\n                    </p>\n                    <p className=\"content\">\n                      TY: Do not eat out unless absolutely necessary! (unless\n                      during busy periods like exams when there’s no time to\n                      cook). Service is extremely expensive there in Denmark, so\n                      as students, we generally buy groceries and cook ourselves\n                      everyday. There’s a huge supermarket 20min walk away from\n                      my apartment so it’s pretty convenient! (bring your own\n                      grocery bags, it’s easier, cheaper and more\n                      environmentally friendly). You will need to pay for the\n                      bags, unlike in Singapore. Basic groceries are around the\n                      same price as Singapore like meat, vegetables, condiments\n                      etc. But fruits are provided according to seasons (Eg:\n                      There were no more peaches nearer to winter and imported\n                      fruits are really really expensive so just stick to their\n                      local products)\n                    </p>\n                  </Grid.Column>\n                </Grid.Row>\n                <Grid.Row>\n                  <Grid.Column>\n                    <h2 className=\"subtitle_left\">Accomodation Choices</h2>\n                    <p className=\"content\">\n                      D: If you choose the school accommodation, it is much\n                      cheaper (I paid only around S$500 per month) for a\n                      two-storey two bedroom house with own kitchen and toilet!\n                      It is randomly allocated and my house is located around 15\n                      minutes away from the school by bus (30 mins by bike). TY:\n                      For AU, the school has both school dorms and properties\n                      around the outskirts of Aarhus that they rent out to\n                      students. So my apartment is right in the middle of an\n                      estate, and my neighbours are all Danish families instead\n                      of fellow students so it’s pretty cool and peaceful:) (the\n                      stars that can be seen every night from my balcony made\n                      exchange an even better experience) My accommodation is\n                      the same as Daryl, it’s a 15min bus ride to the city and\n                      15min bus ride from my apartment so it’s very central, But\n                      one thing to note is that the intervals between bus\n                      arrivals are HUGE so you’ll have to check the bus timings\n                      carefully and make sure to not miss your bus if not you’ll\n                      be late for class.\n                    </p>\n                  </Grid.Column>\n                </Grid.Row>\n                <Grid.Row>\n                  <Grid.Column width={5}>\n                    <Image src={require(\"./Aarhus_pic8.jpg\")} alt=\"pic8\" />\n                  </Grid.Column>\n                  <Grid.Column width={5}>\n                    <Image src={require(\"./Aarhus_pic9.jpg\")} alt=\"pic9\" />\n                  </Grid.Column>\n                  <Grid.Column width={6}>\n                    <h2 className=\"subtitle_left\">Closing Thoughts</h2>\n                    <p className=\"content\">\n                      D: I had no regrets choosing Aarhus.

The Danish, even\n                      though they look unapproachable, were actually super\n                      friendly people! If I did not travel as much as I did, I\n                      would definitely have integrated myself more in the school\n                      culture and partied with them harder!
