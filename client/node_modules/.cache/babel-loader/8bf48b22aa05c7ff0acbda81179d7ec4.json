className=\"content\">\n                      NYU is definitely both a study and play hard school- we\n                      don’t have classes on Fridays so students would party on\n                      Thurs, Fri, and Sat night. Classes can be competitive due\n                      to the participative nature where students are encouraged\n                      to discuss and speak up, but it’s all in good fun. I loved\n                      my professors because they really put in effort to know\n                      every student and gave us resources beyond the class\n                      syllabus such as linking us up with industry\n                      professionals, and really wanted to stay in touch! NYU’s\n                      student population is very diverse as well, so you won’t\n                      stick out – Finance classes tend to be 70% Asians. Local\n                      students are pretty friendly and I did manage to make\n                      friends through classes and international student\n                      sessions, and we do occasionally talk online. We made\n                      friends with other exchange students as well, and even\n                      travelled with them, which was an enlightening experience.\n                      The exchange students team tried to host events for us\n                      such as watching ice hockey games.\n                    </p>\n                  </Grid.Column>\n                </Grid.Row>\n                <Grid.Row>\n                  <Grid.Column>\n                    <h2 className=\"subtitle_left\">Attendance Levels</h2>\n                    <p className=\"content\">\n                      Participation can be pretty heavy especially in my classes\n                      (MKT and BSP3k) and it went up to 30%.

But NYU is\n                      known for their finance curriculum so I would recommend\n                      taking a finance mod even though there’s a limit to 2 FIN\n                      mods. I mapped 3 MKT mods, BSP3k, and FIN2k. The other\n                      exchangers I went with were finance students so they\n                      mapped NYU accounting and econs mods back to NUS as\n                      finance mods. Damodaran also teaches equity val here!\n                    </p>\n                  </Grid.Column>\n                </Grid.Row>\n                <Grid.Row>\n                  <Grid.Column>\n                    <h2 className=\"subtitle_center\">Location</h2>\n                    <p className=\"content\">\n                      NYU is a city campus, just like SMU. So 4 blocks behind is\n                      the main shopping district (Soho) and Greenwich, where NYU\n                      is located, is also home to Washington Square Park, great\n                      cafes, and amazing nightlife. BONUS: There’s a radio\n                      station just around the corner from NYU so we’d frequently\n                      spot celebrities there. I met quite a number of\n                      celebrities in the area so it’s always an exciting\n                      experience! NYC has 3 nearby airports, costing about US$60\n                      via Uber/ Lyft pool to any. You could take the subway but\n                      there are rarely lifts/ escalators so baggage would be an\n                      issue. The commute is also about an hour via Uber/ Lyft\n                      due to heavy traffic.\n                    </p>\n                  </Grid.Column>\n                </Grid.Row>\n                <Grid.Row>\n                  <Grid.Column>\n                    <h2 className=\"subtitle_left\">Getting Around</h2>\n                    <p className=\"content\">\n                      The subway is 24/7 and it’s really convenient! It’s a flat\n                      fare of US$2.50 per way, which has its pros and cons.\n                      Because of that, we ended up walking a lot, because it’s\n                      cheap, convenient, and New Yorkers don’t care about\n                      traffic lights, making it pretty fast as well. There’s no\n                      student fare but my friends who stayed in Brooklyn bought\n                      a monthly pass for about US$120. We would Uber/ Lyft at\n                      night too because it’s really cheap and a lot safer! It\n                      could be US$4 for an Uber Share for 2 for 4-5 subway\n                      stops, which is a lot cheaper than a subway ride.\n                      Travelling around the US was also pretty pricey, where\n                      plane tickets would cost $300 cross country, so we’d bus\n                      to nearby places to save costs.\n                    </p>\n                  </Grid.Column>\n                </Grid.Row>\n                <Grid.Row>\n                  <Grid.Column>\n                    <h2 className=\"subtitle_left\">Cost of Living</h2>\n                    <p className=\"content\">\n                      The cheapest meal around school was US$5, from a Mexican\n                      meal truck that you’d see in TV shows. Lunch time deals\n                      are about US$10, and cafe food would be about US$30 for 2\n                      people. US has a tipping culture as well, which would be\n                      10-18% of the original bill. Don’t try to evade tipping –\n                      my friend got chased by the waiter for doing that. US food\n                      portions are also huge so my friend and I shared a lot to\n                      save costs.\n                    </p>\n                    <p className=\"content\">\n                      We also used discount apps and as many promo codes and\n                      free trials for food deliveries, gym access, and streaming\n                      subscriptions. Grocery-wise, stay away from Whole Foods!\n                      It’s really pricey and not worth it! We mostly shopped at\n                      Trader Joes because it was cheaper and had a variety of\n                      ingredients. The shopping was good though, many brands\n                      were cheaper than in Singapore, and outlets were only a\n                      30min Uber ride away from NYU. NYU gave us free museum\n                      access to MOMA, and the MET had Friday nights free too.\n                      Broadway shows were >$100 even with NYU discounts/\n                      Broadway Roulette. Additionally, NYU makes you buy a\n                      compulsory health insurance plan which is about US$200.\n                      Overall, NYC is really really expensive to live in, so be\n                      realistic about budgeting when applying.\n                    </p>\n                  </Grid.Column>\n                </Grid.Row>\n                <Grid.Row>\n                  <Grid.Column>\n                    <h2 className=\"subtitle_left\">Accommodation</h2>\n                    <p className=\"content\">\n                      We chose to stay off campus because campus accommodations\n                      were US$9k for a three person shared room, including a\n                      compulsory meal plan. We valued convenience over price and\n                      size, so we paid US$3k/month for a two bedroom studio\n                      apartment in Soho, which was 10minutes from school.\n                      However, our apartment was tiny – there was no living\n                      space, only a kitchen area and the rooms were about the\n                      same size as Halls. It did come with free cleaning and\n                      free laundry, which was really convenient. Our friends\n                      stayed in Brooklyn for a much larger space at the same\n                      price, but we knew other exchangers who managed to find\n                      US$1k/ rooms in Brooklyn. If you’re planning to stay in\n                      Manhattan/ near school, be prepared to pay.\n                    </p>\n                  </Grid.Column>\n                </Grid.Row>\n              </Grid>\n            </Container>\n          </Grid.Column>\n        </Grid>\n      </div>\n    );\n  }\n}\n\nexport default NYU;\n"]},"metadata":{},"sourceType":"module"}
