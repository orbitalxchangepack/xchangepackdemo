However, it is located very far from\n                      the main airport, Copenhagen, around 3-4 hours by Bus or\n                      Train which will cost around S$15-30 one way dependent on\n                      how early you buy the tickets.

Buses are differentiated based on\n                      their colours. For example, for blue buses, the bus\n                      conductor will check for your ticket before boarding,\n                      while yellow buses do random spot checks on whether you\n                      did buy a ticket.
