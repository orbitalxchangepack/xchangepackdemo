So depending on what kind of friends and social circles you choose to mix, you could be exposed to the really academic driven culture or party culture of UW. Honestly, I wouldn\\u2019t say that their lessons are missing any much of the academic rigour we have in NUS Biz, class participation is rampant and you have your fair share of projects as well. A note on class part though: I feel that it could be the way that they were brought up and/or the culture that professors create, I truly enjoyed listening to the class participations while I was there.

However, for a majority of modules, professors do give some lee-way.

Thus, one feedback I can give is to really plan your timetable well! This way, you will still be able to travel loads while meeting your attendance requirements. For example, I had only one class on Monday and Friday was my free day \\u2014 in other words I technically have long weekends. I would leave Seattle on Thursdays after my lessons or Friday early morning and return late in the night on Sunday or early Monday when I travel out! As the sem is short (they go by quarters!), there is also no recess week but there\\u2019s still a reading week.

it’s not! hahah many people think that they’ll be going to\n                      DC but the Washington in UW actually refers to Washington\n                      state, which is all the way in the west coast while DC is\n                      in the east coast. It’s a common misinterpretation hehe\n                      one of my exchange friends only realised when she reached\n                      Seattle so that was pretty hilarious. So take note ya!\n                      Won’t wanna be planning your entire exchange thinking that\n                      you’ll be in the east coast then end up all the way at the\n                      other side of America\n                      <Emoji symbol=\"😛\" label=\"sticking tough out face\" /> If\n                      you’ve never been to the states, it’s huge! takes about 6\n                      hours by plane from one coast to the other so getting your\n                      school location right would be a good place to start your\n                      research/ exchange planning.{\" \"}\n                      <Emoji symbol=\"🙂\" label=\"smiley face\" /> Ah if you’re\n                      wondering where “Seattle” popped up from, that’s the city\n                      that UW is located in (and basically your exchange “home”\n                      where you’ll be in most of the time, or not, depending on\n                      how much travelling you’re going to do HAHA) So UW’s in\n                      Seattle, which is in Washington state, in the U.S., hehe\n                      now that we got that settled, let’s dive into the school\n                      itself!\n                    </p>\n                  </Grid.Row>\n                </Grid.Row>\n                <Grid.Row>\n                  <Grid.Column width={8}>\n                    <h2 className=\"subtitle_center\">School Culture</h2>\n                    <p className=\"content\">\n                      Once you reach America (or if you’ve been before/\n                      interacted with Americans), you’ll realise that majority\n                      of them are super friendly and always so eager to strike\n                      small-talks! That is actually one major thing I really\n                      miss, just casually telling the ice-cream girl about your\n                      day and shouting thanks across public busses to the\n                      drivers before alighting. :”) Thus similarly, this is the\n                      case in school as well. However, that being said, don’t\n                      expect to immediately make lots of friends. Small talk is\n                      easy and very often but going a bit further to form\n                      friendships from mere acquaintances will require a bit\n                      more effort. There is a local term dubbed “Seattle Freeze”\n                      which refers to how Seattle is one of the hardest cities\n                      to make friends in. We didn’t quite understand it when we\n                      first reached but we slowly came to realise where that\n                      came from.\n                    </p>\n                    <p className=\"content\">\n                      However, don’t be scared off by that! Firstly, it’s a\n                      generalisation and secondly, it’s how much you want to\n                      make local friends too. I feel it’s really up to you and\n                      what you want to gain out of your exchange. Many people\n                      sign up for exchange with friends and that’s great, akin\n                      to a really extended holiday with some of your bestest\n                      pals. But if you’re going in with the mentality to explore\n                      and make new friends in totally unfamiliar environments,\n                      then you’ll naturally want to expose yourself more to\n                      socialise and make the additional effort to forge new\n                      bonds. In that aspect, I would say UW is pretty great.\n                      There’s a whole lot of orientation activities (esp if\n                      you’re going in sem 1, since it’s the start of the\n                      academic year, not sure if that’s the case if you go in\n                      sem 2), just for exchanges and international students\n                      alone, their international office/team (known as FIUTS)\n                      plans a whole ton of activities and events that you can\n                      sign up for in the weeks leading to the semester as well\n                      as first few weeks. And that’s not including the\n                      school-wide orientation activities that you can sign up\n                      for as well!\n                    </p>\n                    <p className=\"content\">\n                      In terms of party/study school, I would say UW is more\n                      academic in general but as with every school, there are\n                      party crowds. And yes like what you have heard/seen from\n                      America culture influence, there are fraternity and\n                      sororities which mean… frat parties!!! And again, it’s\n                      really up to you. So depending on what kind of friends and\n                      social circles you choose to mix, you could be exposed to\n                      the really academic driven culture or party culture of UW.\n                      Honestly, I wouldn’t say that their lessons are missing\n                      any much of the academic rigour we have in NUS Biz, class\n                      participation is rampant and you have your fair share of\n                      projects as well. A note on class part though: I feel that\n                      it could be the way that they were brought up and/or the\n                      culture that professors create, I truly enjoyed listening\n                      to the class participations while I was there. More often\n                      than not, students speak because of their inclination to\n                      value-add to the current topic and professors facilitate\n                      this very well by bouncing ideas off students, often\n                      generating lively and thought-provoking conversations.\n                    </p>\n                  </Grid.Column>\n                  <Grid.Column width={8}>\n                    <Grid divided=\"vertically\">\n                      <Image\n                        src={require(\"./Washington_pic4.jpg\")}\n                        alt=\"pic4\"\n                        width=\"50%\"\n                      />\n                      <Image\n                        src={require(\"./Washington_pic5.jpg\")}\n                        alt=\"pic5\"\n                        width=\"50%\"\n                      />\n                      <Grid.Column width={16}>\n                        <Image\n                          src={require(\"./Washington_pic6.jpg\")}\n                          alt=\"pic6\"\n                        />\n                      </Grid.Column>\n                    </Grid>\n                  </Grid.Column>\n                </Grid.Row>\n                <Grid.Row>\n                  <Grid.Column>\n                    <h2 className=\"subtitle_left\">Attendance Levels</h2>\n                    <p className=\"content\">\n                      Sadly (for us exchangers), yes attendance is strict.\n                      However, for a majority of modules, professors do give\n                      some lee-way. For example, you get to skip 2 lessons\n                      without any reason required, or have other ways (they call\n                      it extra credits!) to get those participation/attendance\n                      points or just boost your score for that module in\n                      general. Thus, one feedback I can give is to really plan\n                      your timetable well! This way, you will still be able to\n                      travel loads while meeting your attendance requirements.\n                      For example, I had only one class on Monday and Friday was\n                      my free day — in other words I technically have long\n                      weekends. I would leave Seattle on Thursdays after my\n                      lessons or Friday early morning and return late in the\n                      night on Sunday or early Monday when I travel out! As the\n                      sem is short (they go by quarters!), there is also no\n                      recess week but there’s still a reading week. And\n                      definitely public holidays like thanksgiving etc. So if\n                      you’re looking to travel a bit, do take these into\n                      consideration when you plan them. Who says you have to\n                      skip school to travel! I managed to go to quite a few\n                      places like Portland (0 taxes!! and not far from seattle,\n                      highly reco a trip down to do all your shopping), Texas,\n                      Vancouver and Victoria in neighbouring Canada (Washington\n                      state is right at the border so it’s really convenient to\n                      cross over to Canada!) and ALASKA !!! all during the\n                      semester while hitting the strict attendance requirements.\n                      With some planning, nothing is impossible. :DDD Actually\n                      just take note of what I mentioned (timetable! ph and\n                      school breaks), I didn’t even plan my travels much, I\n                      mostly booked them very last minute and all planned after\n                      I reached and settled in to UW HAHA so don’t be scared of\n                      exchange planning ya!\n                    </p>\n                  </Grid.Column>\n                </Grid.Row>\n                <Grid.Row>\n                  <Grid.Column>\n                    <h2 className=\"subtitle_left\">Exam Policies</h2>\n                    <p className=\"content\">\n                      Like mentioned, very similar to NUS Biz.

I can’t remember all\n                      the mods offered and you can probably check the list on\n                      edurec yourself to see what have been mapped in the past\n                      but in general, I would say it’s pretty ideal for\n                      Finance/Marketing students. There were many finance\n                      modules offered, including core and spec mods (I cleared 3\n                      fin3k and 1 mkt3k as I’m doing fin-mkt double spec) as\n                      well as a decent number of marketing modules. Oh, one con\n                      would be that you only have enough credits to take 4 mods!\n                      If you want to take more, you would have to pay and it\n                      wasn’t a small sum, around 2k sgd if I remember correctly\n                      to get additional credits enough to map 5 modules. So if\n                      this really affects your academic plan, you may have to\n                      reconsider coming here (but it would be such a shame\n                      <Emoji symbol=\"🙁\" label=\"sad face\" />\n                      because UW is really so pretty and seattle too! Honestly,\n                      one of the prettiest, if not the prettiest campus I have\n                      been to. They have a library that looks like it was from\n                      the sets of Harry Potter and a cherry blossoms quad that\n                      we unfortunately didn’t get to see them bloom as I went in\n                      sem 1. you’ll probably get to see that beautiful sight if\n                      you’re going in sem 2!)\n                    </p>\n                    <p className=\"content\">\n                      Of course, I think you have the option to try and apply\n                      for other mods outside of Fosters (if you’re thinking of\n                      mapping U/Es) but I’m not sure how easy that will be in\n                      terms of the process and if you will get your mods because\n                      for us, we get the mods after their local students opt for\n                      them so if you’re from another faculty, you may be placed\n                      on even lower priority. That being said, you could always\n                      attend classes when semester starts even if you are not\n                      officially enrolled in that module as many students there\n                      take the first few lessons as “trial” and add-drop is a\n                      lot more common there!\n                    </p>\n                  </Grid.Column>\n                </Grid.Row>\n                <Grid.Row columns={3}>\n                  <Grid.Column width={4}>\n                    <Image src={require(\"./Washington_pic7.jpg\")} alt=\"pic7\" />\n                  </Grid.Column>\n                  <Grid.Column width={8}>\n                    <h2 className=\"subtitle_center\">Location</h2>\n                    <p className=\"content\">\n                      Pretty good location.

Okay technically it’s\n                      not free, you pay a one off fee of around $80 if I\n                      remember correctly as part of your school fees but it is\n                      really worth!

When we first\n                      arrived, it was quite painful for us as we tend to convert\n                      back to SGD all the time. After a while, I decided to just\n                      take USD as it is and it did feel psychologically better\n                      haha I think you’ll slowly come to get used to the prices.\n                      Tax in seattle is high (10%) and on top of that, at places\n                      where you get any form of service (yes hair cuts included)\n                      you are expected to tip. So whenever you see a price\n                      marked on a menu when eating out, always do a quick\n                      x1.2/1.3 in your head to prevent getting a shock when\n                      paying. So yes, America is definitely not a great choice\n                      if you’re on a very tight budget but!! there are some\n                      savings you can get such as shopping (ranging from brands\n                      such as American Eagles/ A&F to Colourpop/ Glossier to\n                      even Apple! side note: I bought my iPhone 11 at almost\n                      half the price of that if I were to buy in SG at that\n                      time) but shop smart! make use of places with low to zero\n                      taxes and deals like Black Friday!!! Thus in general, yes\n                      cost of living is high but I guess it sort of compensates\n                      by savings you can get elsewhere?{\" \"}\n                      <Emoji symbol=\"😛\" label=\"sticking tough out face\" />\n                    </p>\n                  </Grid.Column>\n                </Grid.Row>\n                <Grid.Row>\n                  <Grid.Column>\n                    <h2 className=\"subtitle_left\">Accommodation</h2>\n                    <p className=\"content\">\n                      I stayed on campus because I went on exchange with the\n                      mentality to explore and make friends so I felt hostel\n                      would be best for that. However, I believe you can rent\n                      apartments outside at likely slightly lower prices (when I\n                      mentioned cost of living is high, it literally extend to\n                      everything including dorm fees! I remember it was quite\n                      exorbitant) so it’s really up to you! If you’re heading\n                      there with friends and y’all want to live together,\n                      renting your own space makes sense! Else, hostel would be\n                      a good choice, not just in terms of socialising wise but\n                      also safety! If you’re comparing to SG, America is\n                      definitely not the best in terms of safety. Seattle does\n                      have a pretty large homeless community too and thus, you\n                      may feel a bit unaccustomed and scared even (especially at\n                      nights). Thus, staying on campus would also give you a\n                      higher sense of security. Not trying to scare you off, but\n                      I feel we have to be realistic here too ya. If you’re\n                      really super uncomfortable with the thought of\n                      homelessness around with the smell of weed on the streets\n                      (yes that is legal in Washington state), you may want to\n                      reconsider. But!!! If you’re up to putting yourself\n                      outside of your comfort zone, really exploring the world\n                      out there (you’ll realise SG is really so so small)\n                      compared to being so sheltered inside our little bubble,\n                      you’re up for some of the most magical and beautiful\n                      sights (think grand canyon!! yosemite!! northern\n                      lights!!), some of the warmest people and an adventure of\n                      a lifetime~\n                    </p>\n                  </Grid.Column>\n                </Grid.Row>\n                <Grid.Row>\n                  <Grid.Column>\n                    <Grid>\n                      <Grid.Row>\n                        <p className=\"content_center\">\n                          Ultimately, i can only say exchange is really what you\n                          make it out to be!
