Just use Google or Kakao maps and you\n                      should be fine (people always say Google Maps don’t work\n                      well in Korea but my friends and I used it throughout). I\n                      can’t really remember the cost but it’s quite similar to\n                      SG transport cost. There’s no student fare for exchange\n                      students, or maybe I just didn’t research hard enough…\n                    </p>\n                  </Grid.Column>\n                </Grid.Row>\n                <Grid.Row>\n                  <Grid.Column>\n                    <h2 className=\"subtitle_left\">Cost of Living</h2>\n                    <p className=\"content\">\n                      Quite expensive to eat out. A meal is 8000won on average,\n                      can be way more expensive as well. But the food was\n                      generally good so ok nvm exchange what just enjoy right.\n                      We tried cooking but it doesn’t save much cost also but it\n                      was fun at least. If you really want to save on the cost,\n                      you can eat in school cafeterias or at convenience stores.\n                      Convenience store food BEST. Paik’s Coffee is very worth\n                      the money (big portion) and there are 1000won macarons and\n                      1000won good twisted donuts at neighbourhood bakeries.\n                      Shopping wise, it CAN be cheaper or more expensive\n                      depending on where you shop at la. But ya it’s ok la I\n                      think around average cost of living, it’s rly up to you to\n                      choose to live cheap or live like a king.\n                    </p>\n                  </Grid.Column>\n                </Grid.Row>\n                <Grid.Row>\n                  <Grid.Column>\n                    <Grid.Row>\n                      <h2 className=\"subtitle_center\">Accommodation</h2>\n                      <p className=\"content_center\">\n                        Stayed in an Airbnb near school with my friends!
