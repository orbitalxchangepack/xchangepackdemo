       School. I would say their Business School focuses alot on\n                      open discussion in the classroom, and emphasises on having\n                      two way discussions between the professors and students.\n                      Fortunately, though, some of the classes do not have your\n                      usual class participation %, so that might be good news\n                      for some of you. Academics wise, some classes had a little\n                      more of a learning curve, e.g. FIN351 Private Equity, and\n                      some might be a little more fast paced, e.g. FIN480\n                      Options and Futures. But otherwise, I feel that the\n                      workload is manageable, and the professors are really\n                      approachable if you have any questions!\n                    </p>\n                    <br />\n                    <p className=\"content_center\">\n                      Ann Arbor is a relatively small town (I would think), but\n                      it was a really new experience for me so I really enjoyed\n                      exploring the area and finding small cafes/shops. School\n                      life would be more exciting for sure if you chose to take\n                      part in the fraternities/sororities, or if you go out to\n                      the bars and clubs (they do check your age though, I was\n                      underaged...so didn't really get to see what it was like)\n                    </p>\n                  </Grid.Column>\n                  <Grid.Column width={4}>\n                    <video\n                      src={require(\"./UMich_vid1.mp4\")}\n                      width=\"100%\"\n                      alt=\"vid1\"\n                      autoplay=\"true\"\n                      Loop=\"true\"\n                      muted=\"true\"\n                    />\n                  </Grid.Column>\n                </Grid.Row>\n                <Grid.Row>\n                  <Grid.Column>\n                    <h2 className=\"subtitle_left\">Attendance Levels</h2>\n                    <p className=\"content\">\n                      Some of my classes did take attendence, while others were\n                      pretty lax, so it really depends. But regardless, I think\n                      you would definitely be able to pass, even if you didn't\n                      attend many of the classes, and I know of some peers who\n                      skipped the lessons and just read the materials online and\n                      submitted assignments on time (and did well haha).\n                      Personally, as I was completing a good number of Finance\n                      courses there, I wanted a balance between studying and\n                      having fun/travelling, so I did attend most of the\n                      classes, but arranged my timetable to free up my Fridays,\n                      so I could travel around during the longer weekend!\n                    </p>\n                  </Grid.Column>\n                </Grid.Row>\n                <Grid.Row>\n                  <Grid.Column width={11}>\n                    <h2 className=\"subtitle_left\">Exam Policies</h2>\n                    <p className=\"content\">\n                      So uh...I went in AY19/20 Semester 2...which\n                      coincidentally coincided with the COVID pandemic. I took\n                      my mid-terms in Michigan, and the exams are held in the\n                      classrooms (like the seminar rooms in NUS MRB). I think\n                      the setting was pretty informal. Some of my modules had\n                      easier examinations e.g. FIN480, which was all MCQs.\n                      FIN408/FIN409 and FIN317 had slightly more difficult\n                      examinations which focused on applying the concepts and\n                      doing some calculations. And some modules have\n                      presentations and online submissions instead, with no\n                      actual midterms/finals!\n                    </p>\n                    <p className=\"content\">\n                      Most of the modules do have a decent weighatage on\n                      assignments, so do make sure to get them done!

As the town\n                      population consists of a majority of the University\n                      students, it was pretty deserted when we first arrived\n                      before the semester started. It might not be ideal if you\n                      are looking for a busy city life, but it is pretty close\n                      to Canada, so we got the chance to head over to Toronto\n                      before school started!\n                    </p>\n                    <p className=\"content\">\n                      There are several school facilities for use.

If you continue down from the shops,\n                      you'll reach downtown Ann Arbor, with several unique\n                      restaurants as well as thrift stores to explore! You can\n                      also take the buses out further, though there is only one\n                      major mall in the area, called Briarwood Mall. It has\n                      pretty large clothing stores like Macey's and JC Penney's.\n                    </p>\n                  </Grid.Column>\n                  <Grid.Column width={5}>\n                    <Image src={require(\"./UMich_pic6.jpeg\")} alt=\"pic6\" />\n                  </Grid.Column>\n                </Grid.Row>\n                <Grid.Row>\n                  <Grid.Column>\n                    <h2 className=\"subtitle_left\">Getting Around</h2>\n                    <p className=\"content\">\n                      The campus itself is quite spread out, with Ross Business\n                      School located away from other buildings, but it is a\n                      quick 10 minute walk to the shops and food!\n                    </p>\n                    <p className=\"content\">\n                      As we were a group of 7, we mostly got around by uber when\n                      travelling.

But within\n                      Ann Arbor, you can take the buses for free, with the\n                      school provided student pass :) You can take buses out of\n                      the university area to get groceries at Kroger, Target\n                      etc.!\n                    </p>\n                    <p className=\"content\">\n                      The nearest airport would be the Detroit airport.
