className=\"subtitle_center\">School Culture</h2>\n                    <p className=\"content_center\">\n                      I had my SEP at the University of Michigan, Ross Business\n                      School. I would say their Business School focuses alot on\n                      open discussion in the classroom, and emphasises on having\n                      two way discussions between the professors and students.\n                      Fortunately, though, some of the classes do not have your\n                      usual class participation %, so that might be good news\n                      for some of you. Academics wise, some classes had a little\n                      more of a learning curve, e.g. FIN351 Private Equity, and\n                      some might be a little more fast paced, e.g. FIN480\n                      Options and Futures. But otherwise, I feel that the\n                      workload is manageable, and the professors are really\n                      approachable if you have any questions!\n                    </p>\n                    <br />\n                    <p className=\"content_center\">\n                      Ann Arbor is a relatively small town (I would think), but\n                      it was a really new experience for me so I really enjoyed\n                      exploring the area and finding small cafes/shops. If you\n                      are looking for a more exciting school life, you could opt\n                      to try and take part in the fraternities/sororities. There\n                      are bars/clubs where the students hang out but they do\n                      check your ID.\n                    </p>\n                  </Grid.Column>\n                  <Grid.Column width={4}>\n                    <video\n                      src={require(\"./UMich_vid1.mp4\")}\n                      width=\"100%\"\n                      alt=\"vid1\"\n                      autoplay=\"true\"\n                      Loop=\"true\"\n                      muted=\"true\"\n                    />\n                  </Grid.Column>\n                </Grid.Row>\n                <Grid.Row>\n                  <Grid.Column>\n                    <h2 className=\"subtitle_left\">Attendance Levels</h2>\n                    <p className=\"content\">\n                      Some of my classes did take attendence, while others were\n                      pretty lax, so it really depends.

I think\n                      the setting was pretty informal. Some of my modules had\n                      easier examinations e.g. FIN480, which was all MCQs.\n                      FIN408/FIN409 and FIN317 had slightly more difficult\n                      examinations which focused on applying the concepts and\n                      doing some calculations. And some modules have\n                      presentations and online submissions instead, with no\n                      actual midterms/finals!\n                    </p>\n                    <p className=\"content\">\n                      Most of the modules do have a decent weighatage on\n                      assignments, so do make sure to get them done!
