The train timings are pretty\n                      frequent & the experience is comfortable! Only bad side to\n                      this is the student pass is quite costly (about $800 SGD\n                      for 50 one way trips ) but overall i think it is worth it!\n                      I use the train quite often & the train goes to many\n                      cities like Ottawa, Quebec City, Montreal & Toronto.\n                      Usually a ticket 2 ways will cost about 150+? I had about\n                      20 trips So i definitely made the pass worth it!\n                    </p>\n\n                    <p className=\"content\">\n                      QQ: My opinion might be skewed because I love the bustling\n                      city life, but Kingston is no Toronto ya, it is a small\n                      quiet town. If you are looking for huge shopping malls\n                      with international brands, you will not find it here.\n                      (Think: when school semester ends, it is almost an empty\n                      town cause students go home to Vancouver, Toronto etc). It\n                      takes approximately 2 hours by car to Toronto Pearson\n                      Airport (Use poparide: ~$20-$40), Or 4 hrs by Megabus\n                      (~$45), 2.5hrs by VIA rail (Ticket price varies if you can\n                      snag the escape fares). But some of my friends enjoyed\n                      this slower pace of life. I think life gets pretty good\n                      when you hang out with friends (you will see people from\n                      NUS, NTU, SMU a lot of other exchange students as well),\n                      travel on weekends, hit the gym.
