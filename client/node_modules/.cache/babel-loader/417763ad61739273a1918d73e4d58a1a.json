It is a\n                      big fat no! LA has the worst metro system and if we are\n                      talking about cabbing, maybe a quick 30 minutes if you\n                      manage to avoid their notorious traffic jam :”> However, I\n                      would say this is really not an issue, as long as you make\n                      sure you leave for the airport early.\n                    </p>\n                  </Grid.Column>\n                </Grid.Row>\n                <Grid.Row>\n                  <Grid.Column>\n                    <h2 className=\"subtitle_left\">Getting Around</h2>\n                    <p className=\"content\">\n                      Is public transport cheap?
