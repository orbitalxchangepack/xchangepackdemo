Public\n                      transportation is reliable, efficient and can take you\n                      everywhere. In a big city like Copenhagen there are good\n                      reliable options for transportation such as bus, metros\n                      and local trains. However, public transport is extremely\n                      expensive as there is no student fare. An average 10mins\n                      bus/train ride cost around SGD 3.50. Hence, investing in a\n                      second-hand bike for your stay here might be the most\n                      viable option. Most of us rented a bike during our stay\n                      there (rental is at SGD$20~ per month) as there is a\n                      strong cycling culture in Copenhagen. There are about\n                      400km of cycle paths and more than 1/3 the capital’s\n                      population commute to work by bicycle. However, if you are\n                      not an experienced cyclist and do not feel confident on a\n                      bike, you should not make your first attempt in the\n                      fast-paced traffic of Copenhagen. Many Danes ride very\n                      fast and you are advised to practice first.\n                    </p>\n                  </Grid.Column>\n                </Grid.Row>\n                <Grid.Row>\n                  <Grid.Column>\n                    <h2 className=\"subtitle_left\">Cost of Living</h2>\n                    <p className=\"content\">\n                      R: If you want to save money this is the wrong place to\n                      have an exchange.
