I was sad we were not able to have as\n                      much interactions as I would have loved.\n                    </p>\n                    <p className=\"content\">\n                      Campus life could be quite fun too but as with all school\n                      campus, u might meet super introverted hall mates.. or\n                      those that keep the common areas unkempt. Or you could be\n                      lucky to have those that cook a second serving for u so it\n                      really depends!! Just try ur best to go out and have fun\n                      and talk to random strangers like when u r shopping (i.e:\n                      I asked the person beside buying spinach, how she would\n                      cook that so, why not?)\n                    </p>\n                  </Grid.Column>\n                </Grid.Row>\n              </Grid>\n            </Container>\n          </Grid.Column>\n        </Grid>\n      </div>\n    );\n  }\n}\n\nexport default UNSWSydney;\n"]},"metadata":{},"sourceType":"module"}
