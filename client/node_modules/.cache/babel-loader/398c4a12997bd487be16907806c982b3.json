But\n                      there’s a fare cap of $2.40 on Sundays so we travel like\n                      crazy on Sundays.\n                    </p>\n                    <p className=\"content\">\n                      Alternatives: 1. Walk (Sydney weather is cool and windy\n                      and not humid so honestly feels great) 2. Take the school\n                      shuttle bus to our paddington campus (which is closer to\n                      city and walk. Just do the necessary planning, you can\n                      save here and there from transfers aka 1h transfer buffer\n                      – pls be literate in this sense. Also, the locals are\n                      quite careless so you might be able to pick up some things\n                      on bus rides (I picked up an “Ezlink card”, a iPhone, a\n                      bottle of drink and a purse before).\n                    </p>\n                  </Grid.Column>\n                </Grid.Row>\n                <Grid.Row>\n                  <Grid.Column>\n                    <h2 className=\"subtitle_left\">Cost of Living</h2>\n                    <p className=\"content\">\n                      Eating out is quite expensive, for example: Mala tang is\n                      about $13 per person, Cafe food is about the same price as\n                      SG but 1.5x the portion, Asian food is like $12 for fried\n                      rice but 1.5-2x the portion so we always share. I highly\n                      recommend Betty’s Burger though!!\n                    </p>\n                    <p className=\"content\">\n                      Groceries shopping is super therapeutic. Chicken breast is\n                      $10/kg, minced beef ~$12/kg, milk $2.79/2L, Phil Cream\n                      Cheese is $4.30/block – for some comparison. Dairy\n                      relatively cheaper but ur Asian vegetables are like $2 for\n                      one bunch! You can try visiting the farmer’s market for\n                      cheaper produce! They also have those 1/2 price promos on\n                      snacks and ice-cream ($4.50 AUD for Reeses tub\n                      icecream!!!!! and $2AUD for lindt choc bar.

It\n                      was only a 1min walk to school!! Compared to University of\n                      Sydney (USYD), we are closer to the airport, just about\n                      ~45min direct bus ride. We had a group of 8 NUS students\n                      from SDE; Architecture, and we shared two units right\n                      beside each other. We had so much fun!! The two units\n                      upstairs were occupied by students from NTU so we also had\n                      good egg tarts and baking barters. When they left ,we\n                      raided their fridge for lindt chocolate as well so life\n                      was pretty good. I was sad we were not able to have as\n                      much interactions as I would have loved.\n                    </p>\n                    <p className=\"content\">\n                      Campus life could be quite fun too but as with all school\n                      campus, u might meet super introverted hall mates.. or\n                      those that keep the common areas unkempt. Or you could be\n                      lucky to have those that cook a second serving for u so it\n                      really depends!! Just try ur best to go out and have fun\n                      and talk to random strangers like when u r shopping (i.e:\n                      I asked the person beside buying spinach, how she would\n                      cook that so, why not?)\n                    </p>\n                  </Grid.Column>\n                </Grid.Row>\n              </Grid>\n            </Container>\n          </Grid.Column>\n        </Grid>\n      </div>\n    );\n  }\n}\n\nexport default UNSWSydney;\n"]},"metadata":{},"sourceType":"module"}
