There are cheaper options from food kiosks and\n                      food courts but generally, cafes and restaurants are the\n                      main options. So cooking was our go to on weekdays and we\n                      saved eating out for our weekends. Groceries are generally\n                      quite affordable! Many supermarkets options (asian\n                      supermarkets as well) around so prices are competitive and\n                      you’ll find many things are cheaper than Sg.

We\n                      found it on Airbnb and negotiated for a better price since\n                      we were staying long term. Campus accommodations in Sydney\n                      are crazy expensive (can be up to 1600 per person/month).\n                      Especially since there are many slots for Sydney, try to\n                      find friends to get a place with as it can be cheaper. But\n                      be prepared to pay if you want to stay super near to\n                      school, which is in the city center. If you are staying in\n                      a shared apartment, you are expecting to be paying around\n                      800-1100 a month!\n                    </p>\n                  </Grid.Column>\n                </Grid.Row>\n                <Grid.Row>\n                  <Grid.Column>\n                    <h2 className=\"subtitle_left\">Ending Thoughts</h2>\n                    <p className=\"content\">\n                      Aussie isn’t the top destination for many and\n                      understandably so. The location is comparatively nearer\n                      and more accessible than Europe/US. But there is a lot to\n                      be discovered and enjoyed in Aussie that many fail to see.\n                      I have the fondest memories chasing sunsets, watching\n                      crashing waves at nearby beaches, eating the fluffiest\n                      donuts, tasting the best ice creams (aussie dairy ilu),\n                      and living a dreamlike 5 months with a group of friends I\n                      call home. So if you love nature but need the convenience\n                      of being in the city, can’t stand harsh weathers and\n                      desperately need Asian food to survive, Aussie is probably\n                      the choice for you\n                      <Emoji symbol=\"🙂\" label=\"smiley face\" />\n                    </p>\n                  </Grid.Column>\n                </Grid.Row>\n              </Grid>\n            </Container>\n          </Grid.Column>\n        </Grid>\n      </div>\n    );\n  }\n}\n\nexport default Sydney;\n"]},"metadata":{},"sourceType":"module"}
