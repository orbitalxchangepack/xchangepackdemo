                          lots of sports events for you to feel the true Trojan
                          pride! (FYI I was underaged in the first few months
                          when I went to USA, so I obviously did not party as
                          hard, but it was still fun). Just know that even if
                          you do not like to party, it‚Äôs perfectly fine, there‚Äôs
                          whole lots of other wholesome events to have fun in!
                          One of my favourite USC events was them paying for our
                          transport to Huntington Dog Beach for Corgi Beach Day,
                          where you get to see and play with all those furry

                      This really depends on the module you take! I took FBE-459
                      and FBE-435 under Mick Swartz and I honestly skipped
                      almost every single one of his lessons. However, for some
                      other modules, I know from my peers that the professors
                      will drop at least one grade for students who miss more
                      than 3 lessons without valid reason! So, do your research
                      before you embark on any module!! (PS: You have 3 days to
                      add/ drop/ withdraw a module when you first start school
                      in USC).

                      It‚Äôs not the closest to the downtown but I guess if you

                      distance is a huge issue. Just remember, UBER/LYFT is
                      everywhere in USA so, for someone who could not drive, I
                      had no issue with travelling around. Also, if you are
                      ballsy enough, you can take the metro yourself (might be a
                      bit longer, but at least there‚Äôs no traffic jams), but
                      please make sure you are safe! I had a few close shaves
                      myself so in hindsight, I was lucky enough to not get into

                      Is the school itself convenient to get to the airport?

                      big fat no! LA has the worst metro system and if we are
                      talking about cabbing, maybe a quick 30 minutes if you
                      manage to avoid their notorious traffic jam :‚Äù> However, I
                      would say this is really not an issue, as long as you make
                      sure you leave for the airport early.

                      Is public transport cheap? If you are a cheapo and have no
                      fear of any repercussions, sure, the metro is honestly
                      free (because people usually do not tap in and there are
                      no gantries to stop you from entering the train platform
                      for most stations in LA).

                      Sadly, if you want to be a law-abiding citizen, there‚Äôs no
                      student fare, and I can‚Äôt really remember well but I know
                      it‚Äôs quite expensive because USA charges like a flat fee
                      for any distance you travel (around USD$2.50 I think).
                      Hence, I usually just UBER/LYFT, for comfort and safety.
                      Also, Uberpool is really very cheap in the US and USC
                      provides FREE UBER/LYFT services to and fro areas within 2
                      km radius of USC. Flights around USA are pretty expensive
                      as well I must say.

                      Eating out EVERYDAY is a huge luxury. A normal egg fried
                      rice costs USD$8 for takeaway. If we are talking about
                      dining in, it will be at least USD$20 because they have an
                      insanely high tax as well as tips culture.

                    <p className="content">
                      Also, I would say that their groceries are pretty cheap,

                      eggs, milk and turkey, and I would say they have those
                      things really cheap there! Also, you will love Target and
                      their insanely cheap pillows, mugs etc., as well as their
                      Dollar Tree shops, where things get sold at USD$1 each.
                      ALSO, CAN I JUST SAY, THEY HAVE FREAKING CHEAP H√ÑAGEN-DAZS

                      However, if you spend wisely and not splurge excessively,
                      it‚Äôs worth it.

                      I stayed in school provided accommodation (Troy Hall)!

                      apartment at the very least! I stayed in a 5-persons
                      apartment sharing my bedroom with 2 other graduate
                      students, and I would say it was not an experience I would

                      per month) Also, Troy Hall is like a 10-minute speed walk
                      from the Business Schools, which I would say is the reason
                      why I wake up late every morning and run to classes
